Through his writing, asked if a sister should be allowed to break an ungodly law to let her brother rest in peace.  furthered this thinking during the era of American slavery. Thoreau instructed his audience in Resistance to Civil Government that it is immoral to even pay taxes to any government that tolerated the disgusting institution of slavery. talked heavily of this topic as well, such as in his Letter from a Birmingham Jail. King was jailed for nonviolently protesting against racial segregation in America at the time. All of these contribute to the ongoing discussion of if and when it is ever permissible to violate the law, particularly when the law is inequitable and harmful. To maintain morals, ensure input from everyone, and mitigate minority mistreatment, citizens must have the right to stand up against unjust laws.To remain on the right side of morals, citizens ought to be able to break laws they deem unjust. despite it being law of the land, is inferior to godly law, and cooperating with an immoral law is being complicit with it. Reaching a similar conclusion, Thoreau implores abolitionists to cut support for Massachusetts, which was complicit in slavery, as for abolitionists. God’s virtuous laws as superior to human law, and those that conflict with manly law to follow moral code have virtue and God on their side as well. Both of these esteemed authors concur that civil disobedience is the only noble option and acknowledge the superiority of moral law. Since the law of God should be followed over human law, it is always immoral to let human statutes take precedence over heavenly law. It is clear that it is moral to civilly resist, as God’s moral law shall take priority over unjust human decrees. Civil disobedience ensures that people have the choice to follow just laws, and not tarnish their morals by breaking them.",

Governments in the past have been extremely possessive over the beliefs of their subjects, and oftentimes, when they go too far, they become viewed as unjust by history and their opponents.

It is correct that governments have always written unjust laws, to appease the majority at the time, however, the underrepresented need to express their voice when their rights are being desecrated.
